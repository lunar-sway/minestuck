## [1.16.5-1.8.0.0] - 2022-07-17

### Added

- Toggler block: toggles a specific blockstate that many puzzle blocks have been modified to possess or been given (if they are new), can be toggled itself to instead shut off powered redstone blocks
- Remote Comparator block: checks for blocks at a specific distance and gives off redstone if it matches the type that is directly behind it, can be toggled to additionally matches blockstates
- Structure Core block: records data to specific structures and can permanently shut down specific blocks functionality (summoners and area effect blocks) if otherwise set to read data from said structures, intended for actual use in the Tiered Dungeons update
- Pushable Block: can be pushed in a horizontal direction if right clicked, imagined with sokoban/zelda/portal style puzzles in mind, can absorb platform blocks but cannot be pushed into their way, destroys small plants and any blocks listed in the block tag "pushable_block_replacable"
- Block Pressure Plate: will give off redstone if a player(who is not crouching) or a block with a full faced bottom side are directly above it

- Item Magnet can now be machine toggled to push entities away instead of pulling them closer. Can also move the new pushable blocks upwards (turning them into a falling block entity)

- Summoner now has a gui for improved capacity to set the summoned entity among other small utility
